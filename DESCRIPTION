Title: An implementation of Simulated Annealing on Groups of Vectors
Version: 1.2.2
Author: Nick Simone
Maintainer: The package maintainer <yourself@somewhere.net>
Description: This package is used to implement Simulated Annealing with Vertex Inputs (savi).  
    Specifically, savi takes an iGraph or will create a random iGraph for you with a specific
    number of vertexes.  It then randomly switches the vertices and evaluates the new 
    configuration based on a user-definied scoring function.  Savi will always try to find the
    lowest score possible.  Savi implements simmulated annealing by doing a random walk on
    a Markov chain of a graph's states and then attempts to find the optimal score based on
    a given "cooling schedule."  The parameters and type of cooling schedule are provided by
    the user.  Savi then outputs the minimum score found and the iGraph with the minimum score.
